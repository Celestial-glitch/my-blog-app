# Minimal Blog App

A full-stack Blog App built using **React (Vite)**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** that allows users to create, view, like, edit, and delete blog posts â€” all without a traditional login system. Each post can be protected with a user-defined password for secure edits and deletions. Passwords are securely encrypted using bcrypt before storage.
